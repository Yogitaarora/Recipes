                <h3><span style="color: #993366;">INSTRUCTIONS:</span></h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Dissolve the yeast and sugar in water and keep aside for a few minutes till froth starts to develop on the surface.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine both the flours, salt and vegetables by hand till mixed.I used onions, capsicum, sun-dried tomatoes and olives.Add the yeast and water mixture and olive oil. Combine with a spoon, spatula or just use your hands like I did. The dough should be moist and slightly sticky. Add extra water by the teaspoon if required. While this does not require kneading like most breads, its good to mix for 3-4 minutes till all the ingredients are properly combined. I just transfer the dough to the counter and knead lightly for a couple of minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough with a cloth or cling film, and set aside in a warm, dark spot till it doubles in size. I usually place the dough inside my oven without switching it on.</li>
                    <li>Once the dough has doubled in size (it took mine about 40 minutes), transfer the dough to a baking sheet lined with greased parchment paper. Be careful not to deflate it completely.</li>
                    <li>Lightly stretch the dough till it forms a rectangle.</li>
                    <li>Spread a layer of marinara sauce, sprinkle with basil leaves and grated cheese.</li>
                    <li>Now mentally divide the dough into three parts. Flip the first part on the middle and then flip the third part on top of it, letter style.</li>
                    <li>Seal the edges and brush all over with olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Pre &ndash; heat your oven to 220 degree Celsius and bake for 35-40 minutes till golden brown.</li>
